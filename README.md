# Tourist Booking System

Welcome to the **Tourist Booking System**! This is a simple command-line Python application that allows users to choose a travel destination, select a trip batch, and calculate the total price based on the number of travelers and their ages. Additionally, it collects customer contact details and validates them. The system also provides special discounts for children (6-12 years) and senior citizens (60+ years).

## Features

- **Available Destinations**: Choose from Karnataka, Mumbai, or Goa, each with different places to visit.
- **Trip Batches**: Users can select a preferred batch from available trip batches.
- **Pricing Calculation**: The price of the trip is calculated based on the chosen destination, with discounts for specific age groups.
- **User Details Collection**: Email and contact number are collected from users with validation to ensure the correctness of input.
- **Age-based Discounts**: Special discounts are applied for children (6-12 years) and senior citizens (60+ years).
